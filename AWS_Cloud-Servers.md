# **AWS: Cloud Servers**
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) offers the broadest and deepest compute platform, with over 500 instances and choice of the latest processor, storage, networking, operating system, and purchase model to help you best match the needs of your workload. We are the first major cloud provider that supports Intel, AMD, and Arm processors, the only cloud with on-demand EC2 Mac instances, and the only cloud with 400 Gbps Ethernet networking. We offer the best price performance for machine learning training, as well as the lowest cost per inference instances in the cloud. More SAP, high performance computing (HPC), ML, and Windows workloads run on AWS than any other cloud.

## **Use cases**

### **Run cloud-native and enterprise applications**

Amazon EC2 delivers secure, reliable, high-performance, and cost-effective compute infrastructure to meet demanding business needs.
With over a million active customers and a global cloud presence, AWS has experience in helping organizations of all sizes migrate workloads to the cloud.

Enterprises such as GE, the Coca-Cola Company, BP, Enel, Samsung, NewsCorp, and Twenty-First Century Fox have successfully migrated their on-premises workloads to AWS. They benefited from IT cost savings, improvements in productivity, business agility, and operational resilience. 

You can migrate any workload – applications, websites, databases, storage, physical or virtual servers – and even entire data centers from an on-premises environment, hosting facility, or other public cloud to AWS. Every step along the way, you can leverage AWS’s years of experience to build your organizational, operational, and technical capabilities, so that you can gain business benefits faster.


### **Scale for HPC applications**

Access the on-demand infrastructure and capacity you need to run HPC applications faster and cost-effectively.

High Performance Computing
Accelerate innovation with fast networking and virtually unlimited infrastructure
Run your large, complex simulations and deep learning workloads in the cloud with a complete suite of high performance computing (HPC) products and services on AWS. Gain insights faster, and quickly move from idea to market with virtually unlimited compute capacity, a high-performance file system, and high-throughput networking.

### **Develop for Apple platforms**

Build, test, and sign on-demand macOS workloads. Access environments in minutes, dynamically scale capacity as needed, and benefit from AWS’s pay-as-you-go pricing.

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Mac instances allow customers to run on-demand macOS workloads in the cloud for the first time, extending the flexibility, scalability, and cost benefits of AWS to all Apple developers. With EC2 Mac instances, developers creating apps for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and Safari can provision and access macOS environments within minutes, dynamically scale capacity as needed, and benefit from AWS’s pay-as-you-go pricing.
x86-based EC2 Mac instances are built on Apple Mac mini computers featuring Intel Core i7 processors and are powered by the AWS Nitro System. They offer customers a choice of macOS Mojave (10.14), macOS Catalina (10.15), macOS Big Sur (11), and macOS Monterey (12) as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). Learn more and get started with x86-based EC2 Mac instances here.
EC2 M1 Mac instances (now in preview) are built on Apple M1 Mac mini computers and are powered by the AWS Nitro System. They deliver up to 60% better price performance over x86-based EC2 Mac instances for iOS and macOS application build workloads. EC2 M1 Mac instances enable ARM64 macOS environments for the first time in AWS, and support macOS Big Sur (11) and macOS Monterey (12) as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). Request access for the preview.

### **Train and deploy ML applications**

Amazon EC2 delivers the broadest choice of compute, networking (up to 400 Gbps), and storage services purpose-built to optimize price performance for ML projects.

More machine learning happens on AWS than anywhere else
More customers, across a diverse set of industries, choose AWS compared to any other cloud to build, train, and deploy their machine learning (ML) applications. AWS delivers the broadest choice of powerful compute, high speed networking, and scalable high performance storage options for any ML project or application.

Every ML project is different, and with AWS, you can customize your infrastructure to fit your performance and budget requirements. From using the ML framework that works best for your team, to selecting the right hardware platform to host your ML models, AWS offers a broad choice of services to meet your needs.
Businesses have found new ways to leverage ML for recommendation engines, object detection, voice assistants, fraud detection, and more. Although the use of ML is gaining traction, training and deploying ML models is expensive, model development time is long, and procuring the right amount of infrastructure to meet changing business conditions can be challenging. AWS ML infrastructure services remove the barriers to adoption of ML by being high performing, cost-effective, and highly flexible.


### **Amazon EC2 features**

Amazon EC2 provides the broadest and deepest instance choice to match your workload’s needs. General purpose, compute optimized, memory optimized, storage optimized, and accelerated computing instance types are available that provide the optimal compute, memory, storage, and networking balance for your workloads. Processors from Intel, AMD, NVIDIA and AWS power these instance types and provide additional performance and cost optimizations. Local storage and enhanced networking options available with instance types further help optimize performance for workloads that are disk or network I/O bound. Many instance types also offer bare metal instances that provide your applications with direct access to the processor and memory of the underlying server for running in non-virtualized environments or for applications where you want to use your own hypervisor. To find the right instance for your workload, visit the EC2 instance types page. You can also use the AWS Compute Optimizer to get recommendations on optimal AWS Compute resources for your workloads to reduce costs and improve performance.
